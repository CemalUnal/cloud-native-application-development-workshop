# Getting Started with Prometheus

## Downloading and running Node Exporter
Download the latest stable release of the Node Exporter for your operation system from the [downloads page](https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter). Then extract and run it:

```bash
tar xvfz node_exporter-*.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-*
./node_exporter
```

Now if you visit `http://localhost:9100/metrics` in your browser, you can see that node metrics are available and ready to scraped.

## Downloading and Running Prometheus

Download the latest stable release of the Prometheus for your operation system from the [downloads page](https://prometheus.io/download/#node_exporter). Then extract it:

```bash
tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*
```

By defult Prometheus is configured to monitor itself. We can update this configuration by editing the `prometheus.yml` file. We can tell Prometheus to scrape the metrics that is generated by the node exporter with the following config:

```
- job_name: 'node-exporter'

    # metrics_path defaults to '/metrics'
    # scheme defaults to 'http'.

    static_configs:
    - targets: ['localhost:9100']
```

Start the prometheus instance with the following command:
```bash
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

Prometheus expression browser will be available at `http://localhost:9090/graph`.
